# Blitz
Blitz is a web-based system for building interactive data visualizations. Blitz was designed with the goal of streamlining the process of creating interactive visualizations as much as possible. It leverages prior work done on interaction design to create mappings from low-level data types to high-level interaction paradigms such as filtering, hovering, and selecting, and uses this mapping to add interaction to static visualizations based on the contained data types.

Blitz is built on top of Vega-Lite and D3. Final project for CS448B.
