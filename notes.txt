Interaction design notes.

=========================================================

Types of data:

Ordinal Nominal Quantitative Temporal

=========================================================

Types of interactions:

Primary axis
Filtering
Hovering
Linked viz

Somehow these interaction types should be mapped to the
underlying data types, in a way that makes sense. Since
we're doing a two/three week project we probably don't
have to do super deep research to justify our mappings,
we just need something reasonable.

=========================================================

Data ==> Interaction mappings:

Primary axis interactions:
Ordinal ==> Sort (if the other axis is Ordinal or Nominal)
Nominal ==> Sort (if the other axis is Ordinal or Nominal)
Quantitative ==> Pan & zoom along axis
Temporal ==> Pan & zoom along axis

Filtering:
Ordinal ==> Checkbox or Discrete slider
Nominal ==> Checkbox
Quantitative ==> Continuous slider
Temporal ==> Continuous slider
(Unrelated topic to consider: legend filtering? Was suggested by classmates.)

Hover: I.e. when we are displaying this field in a hover menu
Ordinal ==> Just display
Nominal ==> Just display
Quantitative ==> Progress bar with number overlaid on top
Temporal ==> Progress bar with time overlaid on top (or mini clock?)

Linked viz: I.e. when we are displaying this field in a linked viz.
Ordinal ==> Show an aggregate bar chart for how many times each kind of item appears
Nominal ==> Show an aggregate bar chart for how many times each kind of item appears
Quantitative ==> Show mean/median/mode/range summary statistics (dot plot / box and whisker plot) 
Temporal ==> Show mean/median/mode/range summary statistics (dot plot / box and whisker plot?)
